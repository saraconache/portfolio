    <h2><span>sarahvgomez</span>.bio</h2>

   <p> It was inevitable that I sought a career in design. Any given day, you can find me commenting on the hit or miss of a restaurant's menu design, pointing out the creative genius behind the flawless integration of technologies within a random website, or discussing the importance of conscious design in everything that we do.</p> 

    <p><span>Design itself is a process, a discipline, and an artifact.</span> It's everywhere, and in everything, and that speaks to me. This unshakeable notion and mesmerizing revelation drove me to pursue a degree in architecture which developed (see what I did there?) into web development & graphic design. </p>
    
   <p>To design is to create with purpose, whether that is code, a business card, or a chair. Humans seek to create, and I am no different. A painter interprets a bowl of fruit. A composer scrawls notation on a music staff. A web developer rubs her eyes after coding for 9 straight hours. </p>
    
   <p> We shape what we see into what we want. </p>
